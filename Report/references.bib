        abstract = {I argue that Open Science as currently conceptualised and implemented does not take sufficient account of epistemic diversity within research. I use three case studies to exemplify how Open Science threatens to privilege some forms of inquiry over others, thus exasperating divides within and across systems of practice, and overlooking important sources and forms of epistemic diversity. Building on insights from pluralist philosophy, I then identify four aspects of diverse research practices that should serve as reference points for debates around Open Science: (1) specificity to local conditions, (2) entrenchment within repertoires, (3) permeability to newcomers and (4) demarcation strategies.}

abstract = {The outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the need for seamless, unrestricted, fast, and free access to the latest research results on the virus, on its treatment, prevention, protocols, and so on. Open access to publications and research data, suddenly, became self-evident, not only for researchers in life and medical sciences but also for politicians, journalists, and society as a whole. At the same time, this sudden awareness triggered another debate on the quality and, moreover, the trustworthiness of this mass of information made available most often without any form of quality control (peer review). Thousands of datasets from research on COVID-19 and related topics have already been deposited on data repositories. Our chapter discusses the issue of the quality and trustworthiness of research data in data repositories using examples from the ongoing pandemic. It offers insights into some fundamental concepts and summarizes recommendations for quality assurance and evaluation of research data.}

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the importance of virus genome sequencing to guide public health interventions to control virus transmission and understand SARS-CoV-2 evolution. As of July 20th, 2021, >2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been submitted to GISAID, 94% from high income and 6% from low and middle income countries. Here, we analyse the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 global genomic surveillance efforts. We report a comprehensive analysis of virus lineage diversity and genomic surveillance strategies adopted globally, and investigate their impact on the detection of known SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages and variants of concern. Our study provides a perspective on the global disparities surrounding SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, their causes and consequences, and possible solutions to maximize the impact of pathogen genome sequencing for efforts on public health. One-Sentence Summary The causes, consequences and possible solutions for disparities in genomic surveillance observed in the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic will be remembered as one of the defining events of the 21st century. The rapid global outbreak has had significant impacts on human society and is already responsible for millions of deaths. Understanding and tackling the impact of the virus has required a worldwide mobilisation and coordination of scientific research. The COVID-19 Data Portal (https://www.covid19dataportal.org/) was first released as part of the European COVID-19 Data Platform, on April 20th 2020 to facilitate rapid and open data sharing and analysis, to accelerate global SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research. The COVID-19 Data Portal has fortnightly feature releases to continue to add new data types, search options, visualisations and improvements based on user feedback and research. The open datasets and intuitive suite of search, identification and download services, represent a truly FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) resource that enables researchers to easily identify and quickly obtain the key datasets needed for their COVID-19 research.</p>},
