# Responsible Repositories

Building on previous discussions on epistemic diversity and Open Science, we provide a novel
metric system designed to elicit information regarding the responsibility of a given repository,
as well as documenting a clear workflow for repository maintainers to follow when conducting
this metric system. After defining the characteristics of what constitutes as a responsible
respoitory, we then use two case studies from popular genomic survelience programs, GISAID
and the Covid-19 Data Platform, to illustrate how different interpretations of responsible
openess contribute to different implenetations of responsibility measures. We conclude with
a summary of results and a discussion of methodological challenges and pathways for future
work.
